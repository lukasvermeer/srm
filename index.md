## What is Sample Ratio Mismatch? Why should we care?!

A Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) test can be used to detect a wide variety of data quality issues [(paper)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3330722) [(presentation)](https://conversionhotel.com/session/keynote-2019-run-better-experiments-srm-checks/) that may affect online experiments (aka A/B tests). Only expected proportions and observed sample counts are required as input for this procedure, so this test can be used even in cases where experimenters only have access to summary statistics; such as when using third-party tools.

For more information about Sample Ratio Mismatch please read the [Frequently Asked Questions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/faq.md %}).

## About the project

Sample Ratio Mismatch Checker was created by [Lukas Vermeer](http://lukasvermeer.nl), [Heinrich Mahr](https://heinrich333.github.io) and [Georgi Georgiev](http://blog.analytics-toolkit.com).

### Platforms supported by this Chrome Extension

- Convert.com
- Omniconvert
- Optimizely
- SiteGainer/Symplify
- Visual Website Optimizer (VWO)
- Zoho PageSense

Several experimentation platforms natively perform Sample Ratio Mismatch checks for their users. These platforms will not be supported by our Chrome Extension, because that would be redundant. An incomplete overview of these platforms can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/reference/platforms/index.md %}).

### Known issues:

- Convert: Auto-stopping variants triggers false SRM alert ([#29](https://github.com/lukasvermeer/srm/issues/29))

### License

Sample Ratio Mismatch Checker is distributed by an [MIT license](https://github.com/lukasvermeer/srm/tree/master/LICENSE).
