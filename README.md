> The SRM Checker Chrome extension is no longer being maintained and has been retired.
>
> Over the years, the extension has helped hundreds of experimenters detect Sample Ratio Mismatches (SRMs) and improve the quality of their A/B testing data. However, a few things have changed:
> - Google introduced changes to how Chrome extensions work, breaking the current implementation
> - I no longer have the time to maintain or update the extension
> - Most major experimentation platforms now include built-in SRM checks, making the extension less necessary
> 
> Because of this, Iâ€™ve decided to retire the extension.
> 
> The website and related documentation will remain available for reference, but the extension itself will no longer be updated, supported, or guaranteed to work.

> Thank you to everyone who used, supported, and contributed to the SRM Checker over the years!

# Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) Checker

The Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) test can be used to detect a wide variety of data quality issues [(paper)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3330722) that may affect online experiments (aka A/B tests). Only expected proportions and observed sample counts are required as input for this procedure, so this test can be used even in cases where experimenters only have access to summary statistics; such as when using third-party tools.

This repository contains a [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sample-ratio-mismatch-che/ikielffdbameifemkibfheolelbohipn) that can automatically detect SRM on supported platforms, as well as a [website](https://lukasvermeer.nl/srm/) with more information about the extension.

Platforms supported by this Chrome Extension:
- Convert.com
- Omniconvert
- Optimizely
- SiteGainer/Symplify
- Visual Website Optimizer (VWO)
- Zoho PageSense

Several experimentation platforms natively perform Sample Ratio Mismatch checks for their users. These platforms will not be supported by our Chrome Extension, because that would be redundant. An incomplete overview of these platforms can be found [here](https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/srm/docs/reference/platforms/).

Known issues:
- Convert: Auto-stopping variants triggers false SRM alert ([#29](https://github.com/lukasvermeer/srm/issues/29))

## Contributing

You want to contribute to this project? That's amazing! We'd love that! <3

Feel free to fork the repository on on [GitHub](http://github.com/lukasvermeer/srm), make the changes you want to see, and issues a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). If you are not sure what to work on, we maintain a list of outstanding issues on the GitHub [project](https://github.com/lukasvermeer/srm/issues). (If you don't want to code, adding to that list of issues is also a great way to contribute.)

Thank you for making this project more awesome.

## Testing locally

We utilize the instructions provided [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) regrading testing locally with Github Pages using Jekyll. 

These instructions are only for UNIX-based setups. 

### Initial, One-time Steps

1. Make sure [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) are installed. Use your package manager or ``sudo apt-get install ruby-dev`` or ``sudo apt-get install ruby-full``. On a Mac, [these instructions are quite good](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/).
2. Make sure you are using Ruby version 2.7. Use ``ruby -v`` to check which version is currently active.
3. Install [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) - ``gem install bundler``.
4. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/) via ``sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev`` and ``gem install jekyll bundler``.

### Running Locally

All you gotta do is run this command at the root of the repo (where the ``Gemfile`` is located):

``bundle exec jekyll serve``

You will get output that looks like the following
```console
Configuration file: /media/paul/3638-6263/git/srm/_config.yml
            Source: /media/paul/3638-6263/git/srm
       Destination: /media/paul/3638-6263/git/srm/_site
 Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
      Generating... 
Invalid theme folder: _sass
      Remote Theme: Using theme pmarsceill/just-the-docs
       Jekyll Feed: Generating feed for posts
                    done in 5.583 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/media/paul/3638-6263/git/srm'
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/srm/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

Note the ``Invalid theme folder: _sass`` will show up as a warning; you can safely ignore it as it's related to production deployment on Github. Navigate to the server address given (in this case, ``http://127.0.0.1:4000/srm/`` and you're done!
